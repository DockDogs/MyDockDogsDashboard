Introduction
------------

The DockDogs Scheduling Smartsheet utilizes dropdown menus for many of
the fields. These dropdowns are important as they are the basis of how
reports are generated and sent. Additionally, they are there to
standardize the data that is input by the various parties interfacing
with the document.

!!! danger “WARNING - IMPORTANT” ****If a new dropdown status is
required please contact the DockDogs Office. It is VERY IMPORTANT that
you do not TYPE IN RANDOM OR NEW CONTENT INTO DROPDOWN MENUS OR THIS
WILL BREAK THINGS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.****
